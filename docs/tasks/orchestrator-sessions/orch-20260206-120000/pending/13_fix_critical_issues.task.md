# Task: Fix Critical Build Issues

**Session ID:** orch-20260206-120000  
**Source:** Vibe Orchestrator Recovery  
**Context:** Fidelity Next.js Migration - Testing Phase Issues  
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL - Build Blocker)  
**Dependencies:** None (Standalone fix task)  
**Created At:** 2026-02-07

---

## 📋 Objective

Fix the critical issues identified during testing that are blocking the build:

1. **Route conflict:** `/(accounts)/security` and `/(support)/security` resolve to the same URL
2. **ESLint errors:** 54 unescaped entities, 2 React purity errors, 5 unused variables

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
1. Rename `app/(accounts)/security/page.tsx` to `app/(accounts)/account-security/page.tsx`
2. Rename `app/(support)/security/page.tsx` to `app/(support)/security-center/page.tsx`
3. Fix `nextjs-app/components/ui/Input/Input.tsx` - Remove `Math.random()` from render
4. Fix all ESLint unescaped entity errors in JSX text content

**Out of Scope:**
- Fix unused variable warnings (low priority)
- No new features or page changes

## 📚 Context

### Testing Results Summary
| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| TypeScript | ✅ PASSED |
| ESLint | ❌ FAILED (59 errors, 5 warnings) |
| Build | ❌ FAILED (BLOCKING) |

### Route Conflict
- `app/(accounts)/security/page.tsx` → `/security`
- `app/(support)/security/page.tsx` → `/security`

Both route groups resolve to the same URL because route groups are not included in the URL path.
