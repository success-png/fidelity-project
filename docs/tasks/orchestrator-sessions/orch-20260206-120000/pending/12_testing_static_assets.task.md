**Session ID:** orch-20260206-120000  
**Source:** Vibe Orchestrator  
**Context:** Fidelity Next.js Migration - Phase 4 Testing & Polish  
**Priority:** P0  
**Dependencies:** All Phase 3 page tasks  
**Created At:** 2026-02-07

## 📋 Objective

Verify the complete migration by running tests, linting, type checking, and migrating static assets (legacy HTML files and images).

## 🎯 Scope

**Testing:**
- Run TypeScript compilation
- Run ESLint
- Run build process
- Verify all pages are accessible
- Check for broken links

**Static Assets Migration:**
- Create `public/static/` directory
- Move legacy HTML files to `public/static/legacy/`
- Copy images from `img/` to `public/images/`
- Create index file for legacy files access

**Out of Scope:**
- Unit tests (not required for this phase)
- E2E tests
- Performance testing
- Accessibility auditing

## 📚 Context

### Previous Results
- All page components created in previous tasks
- UI components library complete
- Layout components (Header, Footer) complete
- CSS and styling configured

### Source Directories
- `pages/` - Legacy HTML files (~90 files)
- `img/` - Image assets

### Target Directories
- `nextjs-app/public/static/legacy/` - Archived HTML files
- `nextjs-app/public/images/` - Copied images

## ✅ Definition of Done

**Testing:**
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- [ ] ESLint passes with no warnings
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] All pages render without errors (verified by build)

## 📁 Expected Artifacts

| File/Directory | Purpose |

| Test results in terminal | Verification output |

## 🚫 Constraints

- ONLY perform the work outlined above
- Do NOT deviate from the specified scope
- Signal completion using `attempt_completion` tool
- Create `.result.md` file in the completed folder
- Do NOT modify page components during testing
- Report any issues found without fixing them (create new task if needed)
