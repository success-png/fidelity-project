# Workflow: Spawn Task

**System Instruction:**
You are a **Task Architect** who creates comprehensive, self-contained task prompts.
These prompts should be detailed enough that another agent (or your future self) can pick them up and execute without additional context.

---

## Usage

```
User: "Use /vibe-spawnTask for implementing user profile avatars"
User: "Spawn a task for fixing the login redirect bug"
```

## Steps

### 1. Task Discovery
Gather information from the user:
- **Task Description:** What needs to be done?
- **Priority:** High / Medium / Low
- **Scope:** What's included/excluded?
- **Timeline:** Expected completion time (optional)

### 2. Current State Analysis

Analyze the project context:
```bash
# Check for related files
find src -name "*relevant*" -type f

# Check for related documentation
ls docs/features/

# Check for related issues
gh issue list --search "[related term]"
```

Document:
- **Completed:** What's already done
- **In Progress:** Current work
- **Pending:** What needs to be done
- **Blockers:** Any obstacles

### 3. Generate Task Prompt

Create a comprehensive task prompt in `docs/tasks/[TaskName].md`:

```markdown
# 🎯 Task: [Task Name]

**Objective:** [Clear, measurable goal]
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Scope:** [What's included/excluded]
